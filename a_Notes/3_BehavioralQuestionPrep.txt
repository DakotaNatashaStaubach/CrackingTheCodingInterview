What was the hardest bug I have ever faced?
=====================================================================================================
I faced a mathematically complex systems problem, stretched beyond my background, and turned it into 
a learning breakthrough.

Situation:
In my computer graphics course, we were assigned to implement an incremental 
convex hull algorithm for dynamically updating node positions in a social network visualization. 
The hull had to update correctly when nodes were added, removed, or moved, using geometric 
left/right orientation tests and deque-based traversal. The difficulty increased significantly 
once the hull contained more than three nodes.

Task: 
My responsibility was to implement the 3+ node case of the incremental convex hull algorithm 
correctly — specifically identifying which edges the new point was left or right of, removing invalid 
vertices, and inserting the new point in counterclockwise order while maintaining correctness under 
dynamic updates.

Action: 
The major challenge was that I had not yet taken linear algebra, so I struggled with the 
geometric orientation tests and understanding how vector cross products determined “left” versus 
“right” of a directed edge. I spent significant time debugging cases where the hull would break 
once a fourth point was added.
Although collaboration was not allowed until after submission, I worked through the algorithm 
independently and documented edge cases carefully. After the assignment was submitted, I sought 
out a graduate student peer to review the algorithm and explain the underlying geometric reasoning. 
That conversation helped me understand how I could have implemented the orientation checks more cleanly 
and simplified the hull traversal logic.

Results: 
While I did not fully complete the 3+ node logic before the deadline, I received a strong grade 
due to the complexity of the assignment and the correctness of the portions I implemented. More importantly, 
I gained a deeper understanding of geometric algorithms and the value of proactively strengthening foundational 
knowledge. Since then, I’ve become more intentional about reviewing mathematical prerequisites early when tackling 
technically complex systems problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Susinct Version:
One of the hardest bugs I faced was in my computer graphics class when I had to implement an incremental convex hull 
algorithm that dynamically updated as nodes were added or moved. It worked up to 3 nodes, but once I had four or more, 
the hull would break due to incorrect orientation checks.

The challenge was that I hadn’t taken linear algebra yet, and the algorithm relied heavily on understanding vector 
cross products to determine whether a point was to the left or right of an edge. I spent a lot of time debugging 
edge cases and tracing the geometric logic step by step.

Although collaboration wasn’t allowed until after submission, I later worked with a graduate student who walked 
me through the math behind the orientation tests. That helped everything click. I earned a strong grade despite not 
fully completing the final case, and more importantly, I learned to identify foundational gaps early and strengthen 
them when tackling complex systems problems.”

How do I tackle challenges? 
=====================================================================================================

I tackle challenges by breaking them into smaller pieces and identifying the root cause before taking action. I test 
assumptions methodically and stay calm under pressure. If there’s a knowledge gap, I proactively research, collaborate,
or seek clarification. I see challenges as opportunities to learn and improve, not setbacks.
