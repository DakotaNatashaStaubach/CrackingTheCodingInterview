What are my weaknesses?
- At times I'm an 'over doer'. In the past, I've spent too much time optimizing or making solutions more 
elegant than neccesary. I've been working on prioritizing maintainability and delivering working versions 
first before refining. 

- I used to struggle with asking for help. Earlier in my academic career, I tried to solve everything 
independently. I've learned that collaborative problem-solving is more efficient and leads to better 
outcomes. 

- Occasionally I struggle with imposter syndrome. As a new graduate entering a field with very experienced 
engineers, I sometimes doubt myself. I counter that by preparing thoroughly and continuously learning. 

- I tend to set very high standards for myself, which sometimes leads me to spend extra time refining work
beyond what is required. I've been learning to balance excellence with efficiency and priortize based on 
project impact.



What are my strengths?
- Organization
- Seeing the big picture while also paying attention to low level details. 
- Communication: Asking Questions, Handling Conflict, 
- Learning and Research: Understanding AI's limitations and capabilities 
- cultivating relationships


- I'm adaptable and learn quickly. Proof of this was with transitioning from studying healthcare to 
computer science which required me to build an entirely new technical skillset. When I switched to computer
science at OU my degree plan was for 3 years but I finished it in 2. 

- My military and serving experience has strengthened my accountability and composure under pressure. I 
take ownership of tasks and follow through and maintain high standards for myself and the quality of work
I provide. 

- Because of my experience in hospitality and leadership roles, I'm comfortable cultivating relationships 
with a diverse array of stakeholders and explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. 
My favorite methods are through analogies and creating vizualizations. A picture has a 1000 words. 

- I am a strong analytical thinker. I’m comfortable working with data, identifying patterns, and translating quantitative 
findings into actionable insights. 
   DBMS, Algo, ML, Parallel Distributed Networking

- I naturally think in systems — I look at how processes, data, and stakeholders interact rather than viewing 
issues in isolation.
Built relational schemas, Worked with system-level logic, Debugged multi-component systems

- 

- I would say my biggest strengths are analytical thinking, systems-level problem solving, and communication. My computer 
science and mathematics background allows me to work confidently with data and technical systems, while my leadership and 
hospitality experience has strengthened my ability to communicate clearly with diverse stakeholders. I’m especially strong 
at translating complex findings into actionable insights that align with business goals through analogies or visualizations.
