******************************** ELEVATOR PITCH ********************************

Current Role (Headline): 
I am recent college graduate from the University of Oklahoma, a Specialist (up for promotion to SGT)
in the Army National Guard, a server and trainer at BJ's Restaurant and Brewhouse, and a mom to my 
brilliant 10-year-old son.

College: 
I originally studied Nursing and obtained my associates degree at Tulsa Community College in 2021. 
During that time I discovered my passion for creation with technology and decided I would be happier
pursuing computer science. After completing my military training my husband and I transfered to 
the University of Oklahoma. There I obtained a Bachelors of Science in Computer Science and a Mathematics 
Minor with a 3.6 gpa. I completed many computer science and math focused projects where I gained relevant
technical experience including:
-coding in multiple different languages
-designing, debugging, and optimizing algorithms and programs
-full stack developing apps and websites
-managing, creating, and improving databases
-utelizing AI to assist with highlevel work so I could focus on low level problems
-developing and presenting project proposals, updates, and results

(optional)
An opprotunity for an internship never fit into my schedule as a result of needing to prioritize my job,
military obligations, and taking on a heavy coursework load to complete my degree faster 
(2 years for a 3 year plan). 

Post College & Onwards: 
In January my husband and I launched our "Faith, Family, Fitness Journey" to restablish our foundations in 
those areas and strengthen our family, immediate and extended, spiritualy, physically, and relationally. 
This also was a way for us to inhance our network and develop content for our online fitness focused business 
my Husband and I are working towards establishing. As a result I am in the planning phase of developing an 
app associated to the "Faith, Family, Fitness Journey" that will be added to my github portfolio down the line. 

In February I started reading through "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell. I made a 
github repo that shows my work associated with reading this book. I thought this would be a great addition 
to my career portfolio that any potential employeers could access if interested. I am practicing and refining 
any areas I feel weak in so I can go into any interview confident.  

Outside of Work: 
I also do the occassional construction project and at home rennovation. When I first move to Norman I built a 
loft bed and shelf for my son. I also built custom shelves for our backporch to hold all of our tools and 
sports equipment. In the past I've helped my dad with a few remodels. Eventually we'd like to own a couple 
of investment properties. 

My family and I also love Weight Lifting/Cross Fit, Marshall Arts, Archery, Pickle Ball, 
Roller Skating, Running, Minecraft, and Disney World! 

Wrap Up: I am in search of a career in my degree field. I saw your job posting and felt my skills and 
experience would be a great fit for the role you're wanting fulfilled.
