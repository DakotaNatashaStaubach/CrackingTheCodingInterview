    is the root to why technology is so important and impressive.
    We are constantly in an arms race with other countries. We are 
    constantly in competition with other oposing forces for resources.
    Technology and its advancement and adequate and efficient use is what
    enables us to succeed, survive, and elevate our lives. 
    -Product Ideas for a consumer based economy



=====================================================================================================
What was the hardest bug I have ever faced?
=====================================================================================================
I faced a mathematically complex systems problem, stretched beyond my background, and turned it into 
a learning breakthrough.

Situation:
In my computer graphics course, we were assigned to implement an incremental 
convex hull algorithm for dynamically updating node positions in a social network visualization. 
The hull had to update correctly when nodes were added, removed, or moved, using geometric 
left/right orientation tests and deque-based traversal. The difficulty increased significantly 
once the hull contained more than three nodes.

Task: 
My responsibility was to implement the 3+ node case of the incremental convex hull algorithm 
correctly — specifically identifying which edges the new point was left or right of, removing invalid 
vertices, and inserting the new point in counterclockwise order while maintaining correctness under 
dynamic updates.

Action: 
The major challenge was that I had not yet taken linear algebra, so I struggled with the 
geometric orientation tests and understanding how vector cross products determined “left” versus 
“right” of a directed edge. I spent significant time debugging cases where the hull would break 
once a fourth point was added.
Although collaboration was not allowed until after submission, I worked through the algorithm 
independently and documented edge cases carefully. After the assignment was submitted, I sought 
out a graduate student peer to review the algorithm and explain the underlying geometric reasoning. 
That conversation helped me understand how I could have implemented the orientation checks more cleanly 
and simplified the hull traversal logic.

Results: 
While I did not fully complete the 3+ node logic before the deadline, I received a strong grade 
due to the complexity of the assignment and the correctness of the portions I implemented. More importantly, 
I gained a deeper understanding of geometric algorithms and the value of proactively strengthening foundational 
knowledge. Since then, I’ve become more intentional about reviewing mathematical prerequisites early when tackling 
technically complex systems problems.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Succinct Version:
One of the hardest bugs I faced was in my computer graphics class when I had to implement an incremental convex hull 
algorithm that dynamically updated as nodes were added or moved. It worked up to 3 nodes, but once I had four or more, 
the hull would break due to incorrect orientation checks.

The challenge was that I hadn’t taken linear algebra yet, and the algorithm relied heavily on understanding vector 
cross products to determine whether a point was to the left or right of an edge. I spent a lot of time debugging 
edge cases and tracing the geometric logic step by step.

Although collaboration wasn’t allowed until after submission, I later worked with a graduate student who walked 
me through the math behind the orientation tests. That helped everything click. I earned a strong grade despite not 
fully completing the final case, and more importantly, I learned to identify foundational gaps early and strengthen 
them when tackling complex systems problems.”



=====================================================================================================
What am I excited about?
=====================================================================================================



=====================================================================================================
How do I tackle challenges? 
=====================================================================================================

I tackle challenges by breaking them into smaller pieces and identifying the root cause before taking action. I test 
assumptions methodically and stay calm under pressure. If there’s a knowledge gap, I proactively research, collaborate,
or seek clarification. I see challenges as opportunities to learn and improve, not setbacks.

What are my weaknesses?
- At times I'm an 'over doer'. In the past, I've spent too much time optimizing or making solutions more 
elegant than neccesary. I've been working on prioritizing maintainability and delivering working versions 
first before refining. 

- I used to struggle with asking for help. Earlier in my academic career, I tried to solve everything 
independently. I've learned that collaborative problem-solving is more efficient and leads to better 
outcomes. 

- Occasionally I struggle with imposter syndrome. As a new graduate entering a field with very experienced 
engineers, I sometimes doubt myself. I counter that by preparing thoroughly and continuously learning. 

- I tend to set very high standards for myself, which sometimes leads me to spend extra time refining work
beyond what is required. I've been learning to balance excellence with efficiency and priortize based on 
project impact.


=====================================================================================================
What are my strengths?
=====================================================================================================
- Organization
- Seeing the big picture while also paying attention to low level details. 
- Communication: Asking Questions, Conflict Resolution
- Learning and Research: Understanding AI's limitations and capabilities 
- Cultivating Relationships


- I'm adaptable and learn quickly. Proof of this was with transitioning from studying healthcare to 
computer science which required me to build an entirely new technical skillset. When I switched to computer
science at OU my degree plan was for 3 years but I finished it in 2. 

- My military and serving experience has strengthened my accountability and composure under pressure. I 
take ownership of tasks and follow through and maintain high standards for myself and the quality of work
I provide. 

- Because of my experience in hospitality and leadership roles, I'm comfortable cultivating relationships 
with a diverse array of stakeholders and explaining technical concepts to non-technical stakeholders. 
My favorite methods are through analogies and creating vizualizations. A picture says a 1000 words. 

- I am a strong analytical thinker. I’m comfortable working with data, identifying patterns, and translating quantitative 
findings into actionable insights. 
   DBMS, Algo, ML, Parallel Distributed Networking

- I naturally think in systems — I look at how processes, data, and stakeholders interact rather than viewing 
issues in isolation.
    Built relational schemas, Worked with system-level logic, Debugged multi-component systems

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Succinct Version:
- I would say my biggest strengths are analytical thinking, systems-level problem solving, and communication. My computer 
science and mathematics background allows me to work confidently with data and technical systems, while my leadership and 
hospitality experience has strengthened my ability to communicate clearly with diverse stakeholders. I’m especially strong 
at translating complex findings into actionable insights that align with business goals through analogies or visualizations.
